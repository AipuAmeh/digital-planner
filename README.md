## Description

Digital Planner is an interactive application that allows you to add daily tasks to your personal profile!

## Installation

To review my current work, copy the url of my main branch and clone it into your local repository. 

## This Week:

This week I worked on my Feature 3, which is calling a Bible API. 

### Running the Application

 - Once this branch is in your environment, create a .env file based off of the .envExample file for your own confidential secrets.
 - Navigate into the folder titled `client` and run `npm install`.
 - Navigate into the folder titled `server` and run `npm install`.
 - Then start both the server and client folders, by running `npm run develop` in the main terminal.
 - Navigate to [http://localhost:3000/](http://localhost:3000/) to view the homepage with the option to either signup or login to your account.
 - Test the functionality by signing in, hard refreshing to view logout button, and logging back in again.
 - Notice how you are only able to view the users profile page if you are logged in.

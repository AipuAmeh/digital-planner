# Digital Planner

## Description

Digital Planner is an interactive application that allows you to add daily tasks to your personal profile!

Follow along with me as I code! Visit my Trello board to stay up to date with the features that I am working on: [Trello Board](https://trello.com/b/Cu7Oloup/to-do-list)

## Installation

To review my current work, copy the url of my main branch and clone it into your local repository. 

### Running the Application

 - Once this branch is in your environment, create a .env file based off of the .envExample file for your own confidential secrets.
 - Install any packages on your environment by running `npm install`.
 - Then start both the server and client folders, by running `npm start:dev`.
 - Navigate to [http://localhost:3000/todo](http://localhost:3000/todo) to see my first feature, adding and deleting a todo/reflection!

## Installation

### CLONING
To review my current work, start a new project in your visual studio code, or any similar code editor. Use `git clone [SSH URL]` and copy the url of my main branch and clone it into your local repository. 

The SSH URL is found by clicking on the green `<> Code` button under the `<> Code` tab.
### FORKING 
You can also fork the respository by clicking the `Fork` button and following the instructions listed on the screen.

## Running the Application

 - Once this branch is in your environment, create a .env file based off of the .envExample file for your own confidential secrets.
### Client-Side
   - Navigate into the folder titled `client` and run ```npm install```
    
### Server-Side
   - Navigate into the folder title `server` and run ```npm install```
   - Run ```npm run build ```
   - Run Migrations with: ```npm run migration:run```
 - Start both the Server and Client folders in the main terminal, by running ```npm run develop```
   
 - (!! IMPORTANT !!) Make sure to create a `.env` file in the server folder of your project. Use the `.envEXAMPLE` as a template for your database name, username, password, personal port, and a random password for your JWT secret.
